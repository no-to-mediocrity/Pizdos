##How to Play

Once the program is running, you will see a menu with several options:

    Feed the cat
    Give the cat medicine
    Let the cat rest
    Send the cat to work
    Quit

Use the number keys to select an option and press enter to execute it. The program will display the cat's current state and provide feedback on the action you have taken.

The cat's current state is represented by various ASCII art images, which change depending on the cat's health, weight, and age.
About the Code

The project is written in Kotlin and uses the Java standard library for input and output. The program uses a fixed-rate timer to update the display every second.

The Cat class represents the virtual cat and contains various properties that determine the cat's state. The getInput function processes user input and updates the cat's state accordingly. The displayMenu function updates the display and shows the user the cat's current state.

The program also contains several ASCII art images that represent the cat's current state. These images are stored as string literals and are displayed on the console using the println function.
